      <h3>[Page 3 - The Benefits!]</h3>
      <p>
        IT IS CONVENIENT: When it comes to online trading, you only need to open a trading account via internet and you’re good to go. You’re not bound by time and place as long as you have an internet connection. Hence, online trading is convenient and accessible from anywhere with limited hassle. It also saves time.
IT IS CHEAPER: In online stock trading, the stock broker fee which you will have to pay is lower when compared to the commission charged by traditional method. If you trade in a sufficiently large volume of stocks, it is possible for you to be able to negotiate your broker’s fees.
YOU CAN MONITOR YOUR INVESTMENTS ANYTIME: Online trading allows you to buy or sell shares according to your convenience. It offers advanced interfaces and the ability for investors to see how their money is performing throughout the day. You can use your phone or your computer to evaluate your profit or loss.
IT ALMOST ELIMINATES THE MIDDLEMAN: Online trading allows you to trade with virtually no direct broker communication. Apart from reducing the overall trading cost, this benefit also makes the trading hassle free, making this service much more lucrative.
INVESTOR HAS GREATER CONTROL: Online traders can trade whenever they wish to. On the other hand, in traditional trading, an investor may be stuck until he or she is able to contact their broker or when the broker is able to place their order. Online trading allows nearly instantaneous transactions. Also, investors are able to review all of their options instead of depending on a broker to tell them the best bets for their money. They’re able to monitor their investments, make decisions and buy/sell stock on their own without any outside interference; thus, giving them greater control over their investment.
FASTER TRANSACTIONS: Online banking is fast and efficient. Funds can be transferred between accounts almost instantly, especially if the two accounts are held at the same banking institution. All it takes to be able to buy or sell stocks is a single click of the mouse. Through this, a quicker exchange can be made which may also ensure quicker earnings.
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ONE’S MONEY: This is a hidden advantage of online trading which you wouldn’t want to pass up on. Just like conventional stock trading, you can predict the market behavior and use this to predict a rise or fall in price of the stock. You’ll be handling your own finances and be responsible for them. Over time, you become more experienced in understanding the market, and good investment opportunities from the bad ones. This knowledge about money is very useful, and having this on your resume makes you more marketable to companies looking to fill a well-paying position in the finance department. So while making a quick buck, you also manage to become financially smarter, in both your professional and personal life.
